    Question:
    You are building a Python script that manages files and directories. You need to:

        1. Check if a file named "data.txt" exists in the current directory.
        2. If it exists, print "File exists"; otherwise, create the file and write "Hello, World!" into it.
        3. Retrieve and print the absolute path of "data.txt".
        4. Print the list of all files and directories in the current working directory.
