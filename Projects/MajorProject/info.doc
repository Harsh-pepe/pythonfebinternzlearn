 Project Title: Online Bookstore Management System  

Objective:  
Create a simple Online Bookstore using Flask where users can view books by category and submit an inquiry form. An admin panel should allow adding new books.  


 Project Requirements:  
    1. Use Flask for backend development.  
    2. Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management (SQLite).  
    3. Use Jinja Templating for rendering HTML pages.  
    4. Implement a Books Catalog with filtering by category.  
    5. Implement an Inquiry Form for users to request information.  
    6. Create an Admin Panel to add books to the catalog.

 Step-by-Step Breakdown:  

 Step 1: Set Up the Flask Project  
- Install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.  
- Create a new Flask app (`server.py`).  
- Configure the SQLite database (`bookstore.db`).  

 Step 2: Define the Database Models  
- Create a Book model with fields: `id`, `title`, `author`, `category`, `price`, `description`.  
- Create an Inquiry model with fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `book_title`, `message`.  

 Step 3: Create the Homepage  
- Fetch all books from the database and display them in a table.  
- Add a category filter to view books by genre (e.g., Fiction, Science, History).  

 Step 4: Implement the Inquiry Form  
- Add a form where users can submit inquiries about a book.  
- Save inquiry data into the database.  
- Redirect users back to the homepage after submission.  

 Step 5: Build the Admin Panel  
- Create an admin page where new books can be added to the database.  
- Display a list of all books in the admin panel.  

 Step 6: Test and Run the Application  
- Run the Flask app and check that books are displayed correctly.  
- Test the inquiry form to ensure data is stored in the database.  
- Test the admin panel to add new books.
